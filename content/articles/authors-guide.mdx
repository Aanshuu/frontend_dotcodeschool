Welcome to the DotCodeSchool content authoring guide! This template demonstrates all the formatting options available to you when writing articles for our platform. Use this as a reference when creating your own educational content.

## Basic Text Formatting

DotCodeSchool supports standard Markdown syntax for basic text formatting:

- **Bold text** is created with `**double asterisks**`
- _Italic text_ is created with `*single asterisks*`
- **_Bold and italic_** is created with `***triple asterisks***`
- [Hyperlinks](https://polkadot.network) use `[link text](https://url.com)` syntax

## Heading Structure

Use headings to organize your content in a hierarchical structure. We support six levels of headings:

# Heading 1 (Article Title)

## Heading 2 (Main Sections)

### Heading 3 (Sub-sections)

#### Heading 4 (Sub-sub-sections)

##### Heading 5 (Small sections)

###### Heading 6 (Minor points)

Good heading structure improves readability and makes your content more accessible. It also generates the table of contents automatically.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Create bullet points with asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens:

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item (indent with two spaces)
  - Another nested item
- Item three

### Ordered Lists

Create numbered lists with numbers followed by periods:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step A (indent with three spaces)
   2. Sub-step B

## Code Examples

### Inline Code

Use backticks to format `inline code` or technical terms within paragraphs.

### Code Blocks

For multi-line code samples, use triple backticks with a language identifier:

```rust
#[pallet::weight(10_000)]
pub fn create_item(
    origin: OriginFor<T>,
    item_id: u32,
    item_name: Vec<u8>,
) -> DispatchResult {
    let sender = ensure_signed(origin)?;

    // Ensure the item doesn't already exist
    ensure!(!ItemExists::<T>::contains_key(item_id), Error::<T>::ItemAlreadyExists);

    // Create a new item
    let bounded_name: BoundedVec<_, _> = item_name.try_into()
        .map_err(|_| Error::<T>::NameTooLong)?;

    // Store the item
    Items::<T>::insert(item_id, (bounded_name, sender.clone()));

    // Emit an event
    Self::deposit_event(Event::ItemCreated(item_id, sender));

    Ok(())
}
```

You can also specify a file name for your code blocks:

```typescript filename="app.ts"
function calculateTotalSupply(api: ApiPromise): Promise<BigNumber> {
  return api.query.balances.totalIssuance().then((issuance) => {
    return new BigNumber(issuance.toString());
  });
}
```

The following languages are supported for syntax highlighting:

- rust
- typescript/javascript
- go
- cpp/c++
- python
- solidity
- json
- toml
- yaml
- sql
- shell/bash

## Blockquotes

Use the `>` character at the beginning of lines to create blockquotes:

> Substrate provides a flexible framework for blockchain development.
>
> — Gavin Wood

## Links

[External links](https://polkadot.network) open in a new tab by default.

For internal links to other articles, use relative paths:

[Introduction to Substrate](/articles/intro-to-substrate)

## Images

Include images with the syntax: `[alt text](image-url)`

![Polkadot Logo](https://public.bnbstatic.com/static/academy/uploads/a7cd5a58229d4ba8a3c4baf072a5dd86.png)

Add alternative text within the square brackets for accessibility.

## Callouts and Notes

For important points, use blockquotes with formatting:

> **Tip:** This offers helpful advice for better results.

For additional information, use callouts:

<InfoBox>
  **Note:** This is an important note that readers should pay attention to.
</InfoBox>

<Warning>This highlights a potential problem or risk.</Warning>

<Error>This indicates an error or failure.</Error>

<Success>This indicates a successful outcome or achievement.</Success>

## Advanced Examples

### CLI Command Example

When showing command line instructions, use code blocks with the `bash` or `shell` language:

```bash
# Install the Substrate node template
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
cd substrate-node-template
cargo build --release
```

### Terminal Output Example

Show expected output with a code block:

```
2023-11-15 10:23:45 🔨 Initializing Genesis block/state (state: 0x5843…1f64, header-hash: 0x6ada…0d38)
2023-11-15 10:23:45 👴 Loading GRANDPA authority set from genesis on what appears to be first startup.
2023-11-15 10:23:45 ⏱  Loaded block-time = 6s from block 0x6ada72d82c8a4546aefa34a9486a6f0db71cae88460974690d1efa741f70d38 (0 aka 0x6ada…0d38)

```

### API Examples

When showing API usage, provide context and explanation:

```typescript
// Connect to a Substrate node
const api = await ApiPromise.create({ provider: wsProvider });

// Make a query to get the current validators
const validators = await api.query.session.validators();
console.log(`Current validators: ${validators.join(", ")}`);

// Subscribe to new blocks
const unsubscribe = await api.rpc.chain.subscribeNewHeads((header) => {
  console.log(`New block #${header.number} has hash ${header.hash}`);
});
```

## Proper Attribution

When quoting or referencing others' work, always provide proper attribution:

> "The Polkadot network uses a sophisticated governance mechanism that allows it to evolve gracefully over time at the ultimate behest of its assembled stakeholders."
>
> — Polkadot Whitepaper

## Best Practices for Authors

1. **Start with an overview**: Briefly explain what the article covers and why it matters.
2. **Be concise**: Keep sentences clear and straight to the point.
3. **Use examples**: Illustrate concepts with practical examples.
4. **Break up text**: Use headings, lists, and code blocks to avoid large text walls.
5. **Target your audience**: Consider the technical background of your readers.
6. **Provide context**: Explain why something works, not just how it works.
7. **Include resources**: Link to additional documentation or tools when relevant.
8. **Review thoroughly**: Check for technical accuracy and clarity before submitting.
