## Course Structure Overview

Our courses follow a hierarchical structure:

```
content/courses/course-slug/
├── course-slug.mdx           # Course metadata and description
└── sections/                 # Container for all course sections
    └── section-slug/         # A section of the course
        ├── section-slug.mdx  # Optional section metadata
        └── lessons/          # Container for all lessons in this section
            ├── lesson-1-slug/    # First lesson directory
            │   ├── lesson-name.mdx  # Lesson content
            │   └── files/        # Optional code files for the lesson
            │       └── source/   # OR template/ and solution/ pair
            └── lesson-2-slug/    # Second lesson directory
                ├── lesson-name.mdx  # Lesson content
                └── files/        # Optional code files
                    ├── template/ # Files with TODOs for learners
                    └── solution/ # Completed files for reference
```

## Creating a New Course

To create a new course:

### Option 1: Using the Helper Script

1. Navigate to the `content/courses/course-template` directory in your terminal
2. Run the helper script with your desired course slug:
   ```bash
   ./create-course.sh your-course-slug
   ```
3. The script will create a new course directory with the proper structure
4. Follow the instructions provided by the script to customize your course

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. Copy the `content/courses/course-template` directory to create a new course with the recommended structure
2. Rename the directory to your course slug (e.g., `rust-state-machine`)
3. Rename `course-template.mdx` to match your course slug (e.g., `rust-state-machine.mdx`)
4. Edit the course metadata and content in the renamed file
5. Customize the sections and lessons to fit your course content

Alternatively, you can create the structure manually:

1. Create a new directory under `content/courses/` with your course slug
2. Create a course metadata file named after your course slug
3. Create a `sections` directory to contain your course sections

### Course Metadata File

The course metadata file (e.g., `course-slug.mdx`) should include frontmatter with the following fields:

```mdx
---
slug: rust-state-machine
title: Rust State Machine
author: Your Name
description: A concise description of your course.
level: Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced
language: Programming language(s) used
github_url: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
tags: ["rust", "state machine", "programming"]
---
```

## Adding Sections and Lessons

### Creating a Section

1. Create a directory for your section under `sections/` with a descriptive slug (e.g., `getting-started`)
2. Create a `lessons` directory within your section to contain individual lessons

### Section Metadata (Optional)

You can optionally include a section metadata file (e.g., `section-slug.mdx`) in your section directory with the following frontmatter:

```mdx
---
slug: getting-started
title: Getting Started
order: 1  # Determines the order of sections within the course
description: A brief description of what this section covers
---
```

This metadata helps organize your course sections and provides additional information to learners.

### Creating a Lesson

1. Create a directory for your lesson under `lessons/` with a descriptive slug (e.g., `initialize-project`)
2. Create an MDX file for your lesson content (e.g., `initialize-project.mdx`)
3. Optionally, create a `files` directory if your lesson includes code examples

### Lesson Metadata

Each lesson MDX file should include frontmatter with at least:

```mdx
---
slug: initialize-your-rust-project
title: Initialize your Rust Project
order: 1  # Optional: Determines the order of lessons within a section
---
```

You can also include additional metadata fields if needed for your specific lesson.

## Lesson Content Format

Lessons are written in MDX (Markdown with JSX) format. Here are some guidelines:

1. Start with a level-1 heading (`#`) that matches your lesson title
2. Use level-2 headings (`##`) for major sections within your lesson
3. Use level-3 headings (`###`) for subsections
4. Include code blocks with language specifiers for syntax highlighting:

```mdx
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
```

5. Use numbered lists for step-by-step instructions
6. Link to files in your lesson's `files` directory using relative paths:

```mdx
See the [main.rs](files/source/src/main.rs) file for the complete code.
```

## Working with Code Files

Each lesson can have an optional `files` directory that must follow one of these patterns. It's important to understand the purpose of each pattern to choose the right one for your lesson:

### Source Directory

Use a `source` directory when you want to show the final state of files after an action is taken, without requiring the learner to implement anything themselves:

```
files/
└── source/
    ├── src/
    │   └── main.rs
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── Cargo.lock
```

The `source` directory is ideal for:
- Initial setup steps (e.g., project initialization)
- Demonstrating concepts without requiring implementation
- Providing reference code that learners can examine
- Steps where the focus is on understanding rather than coding

### Template and Solution Directories

Use `template` and `solution` directories when you want learners to implement something themselves:

```
files/
├── template/
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── main.rs  # Contains TODOs and instructions
│   └── Cargo.toml
└── solution/
    ├── src/
    │   └── main.rs  # Contains the completed implementation
    └── Cargo.toml
```

The `template`/`solution` pair is ideal for:
- Hands-on coding exercises where learners implement features
- Teaching specific programming patterns or techniques
- Guiding learners through a step-by-step implementation
- Providing both guidance (template) and a reference implementation (solution)

**Important**: When using template/solution pairs:
- Ensure the solution correctly implements all TODOs from the template
- Keep the file structure identical between template and solution
- Make sure the solution code compiles and runs correctly
- Include enough comments in the solution to explain the implementation

#### Template Files

Template files should include clear TODO comments that guide the learner on what to implement:

```rust
/* TODO: create a new public struct named `Pallet`. */
```

#### Solution Files

Solution files should contain the complete, working implementation:

```rust
pub struct Pallet {}
```

## Creating a Pull Request

When you're ready to contribute your course or changes:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your changes
3. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages
4. Push your branch to your fork
5. Create a pull request to the main repository

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Your course follows the directory structure outlined in this guide
- [ ] Your course metadata file includes all required fields
- [ ] All lesson files include proper frontmatter
- [ ] Code examples in template/solution pairs match correctly
- [ ] All links to files use relative paths and are correct
- [ ] Your content is free of spelling and grammatical errors

## File Naming and Structure Conventions

Consistent naming and structure are crucial for maintainability and user experience:

### Directory and File Naming

- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens) for all directory and file names
- Make names descriptive but concise
- Avoid special characters other than hyphens
- Use the same naming pattern throughout your course

### File Structure Consistency

- Maintain consistent depth across similar sections
- Keep related files together in the same directory
- Follow the established pattern for lesson files and code examples
- Ensure all required files are present in each directory

## Best Practices

1. **Progressive Complexity**: Structure your course to gradually increase in complexity
2. **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for each task
3. **Explain Why**: Don't just show what to do, explain why it's done that way
4. **Complete Examples**: Ensure your code examples are complete and functional
5. **Consistent Style**: Maintain a consistent writing style throughout your course
6. **Target Audience**: Clearly indicate the prerequisite knowledge for your course
7. **Test Your Code**: Verify that all code examples work as expected
8. **Review Your Content**: Have someone else review your course before submitting

By following this guide, you'll create courses that are consistent with our platform's standards and provide an excellent learning experience for our users.

Happy teaching!
